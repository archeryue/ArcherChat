# 🧠 Memory System - Implementation Complete!

## ✅ Fully Implemented and Working

The automatic, aggressive, trust-based memory system with 500-token budget is now **live and ready to use**!

### What's Been Built

#### 1. **Core Engine** ✅
- Memory types and interfaces (`src/types/memory.ts`)
- Storage layer with Firestore (`src/lib/memory/storage.ts`)
- Automatic extraction with Gemini (`src/lib/memory/extractor.ts`)
- Aggressive cleanup system (`src/lib/memory/cleanup.ts`)
- Memory loader for chat (`src/lib/memory/loader.ts`)

#### 2. **API Routes** ✅
- `GET /api/memory` - Fetch user's memory
- `DELETE /api/memory` - Clear all memory
- `DELETE /api/memory/[id]` - Delete specific fact

#### 3. **Chat Integration** ✅
- Automatic memory loading into system prompt
- Background memory extraction after conversations
- Automatic cleanup to enforce limits

#### 4. **User Interface** ✅
- User dropdown menu in sidebar with profile link
- Full memory profile page at `/profile`
- View all memories grouped by category
- Delete individual memories
- Clear all memories
- Usage statistics display

## 🎯 System Behavior

### Automatic Memory Extraction

```
User chats normally (>5 messages, >2 minutes)
    ↓
Conversation ends
    ↓
Background extraction triggered (Gemini analyzes conversation)
    ↓
Facts extracted (confidence ≥0.6)
    ↓
Facts saved to Firestore
    ↓
Cleanup runs (enforce 8/12/6 limits, 500 token budget)
    ↓
Next conversation: Memory loaded into system prompt
    ↓
AI personalizes responses based on memory
```

### Memory Tiers & Retention

| Tier | Max Facts | Retention | Use Case |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| CORE | 8 | Forever | Profile info, permanent preferences |
| IMPORTANT | 12 | 90 days | Key preferences, technical info |
| CONTEXT | 6 | 30 days | Current projects, temporary context |

**Total**: Max 26 facts, ~500 tokens

### Importance Scoring

Facts are ranked by:
- **Confidence** (40%) - How sure the AI is
- **Recency** (30%) - Newer = better
- **Usage** (30%) - Used in chats = more important

Low-scoring facts are pruned first when limits are hit.

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Users

1. **Just chat normally!** The system automatically learns.
2. **View your memory**: Click your profile picture → "Memory Profile"
3. **Manage memories**:
   - Delete individual facts you don't want remembered
   - Clear all memory to start fresh

### For Developers

#### Access memory in code:
```typescript
import { getUserMemory, loadMemoryForChat } from "@/lib/memory";

// Get raw memory
const memory = await getUserMemory(userId);

// Get formatted memory for chat
const memoryContext = await loadMemoryForChat(userId);
```

#### Trigger extraction manually:
```typescript
import { processConversationMemory, cleanupUserMemory } from "@/lib/memory";

await processConversationMemory(conversationId, userId);
await cleanupUserMemory(userId);
```

## 💰 Cost Impact

### Additional Costs

| Component | Cost/Month |
|-----------|------------|
| Memory extraction (100 conversations) | ~$0.75 |
| Memory storage in Firestore | FREE |
| Memory loading (included in chat) | $0 |
| **Total Additional Cost** | **~$1/month** |

Still well within your $30 budget! ✅

### Token Usage per Chat

- Without memory: ~100 tokens
- With memory: ~600 tokens (500 memory + 100 prompt)
- Cost increase: ~$0.00004 per message

For 1000 messages/month: **$0.04 additional cost**

## 🧪 Testing

### Test the Memory System

1. **Start a conversation** about yourself:
   ```
   "Hi! I'm Archer, a software engineer. I prefer TypeScript
   and I'm currently building an AI chatbot."
   ```

2. **Chat for a few messages** (>5 messages, >2 minutes)

3. **End the conversation** and wait ~10 seconds

4. **Check your profile**:
   - Click your avatar → "Memory Profile"
   - You should see extracted facts!

5. **Start a new conversation**:
   ```
   "What programming language should I use for my next project?"
   ```

   The AI should reference your TypeScript preference!

## 🔧 Configuration

### Adjust Memory Limits

Edit `src/types/memory.ts`:
```typescript
export const MEMORY_LIMITS = {
  core: {
    max_facts: 8,       // Change this
    max_age: Infinity,
  },
  important: {
    max_facts: 12,      // Change this
    max_age: 90,        // Change this (days)
  },
  context: {
    max_facts: 6,       // Change this
    max_age: 30,        // Change this (days)
  },
  max_total_tokens: 500, // Change this
};
```

### Adjust Extraction Threshold

Edit `src/lib/memory/extractor.ts`:
```typescript
export function shouldExtractMemory(messageCount: number, durationMs: number): boolean {
  const MIN_MESSAGES = 5;           // Change this
  const MIN_DURATION_MS = 2 * 60 * 1000;  // Change this

  return messageCount >= MIN_MESSAGES && durationMs >= MIN_DURATION_MS;
}
```

## 🎉 You're All Set!

The memory system is:
- ✅ Automatically learning from conversations
- ✅ Aggressively cleaning up old memories
- ✅ Trusting the AI (no user approval needed)
- ✅ Staying under 500 token budget
- ✅ Accessible via user dropdown → "Memory Profile"

**Go test it out!** Start chatting and see your memory profile grow! 🚀

## 📝 Future Enhancements

If you want to extend the system later:

1. **Manual memory addition**: Let users add facts manually
2. **Memory search**: Search through all memories
3. **Memory export**: Download memories as JSON/markdown
4. **Shared memories**: Family-wide knowledge base
5. **Memory analytics**: Charts showing memory growth over time
6. **Smart forgetting**: ML-based importance scoring
7. **Memory categories customization**: Let users define categories

But for now, enjoy your automatic, intelligent memory system! 🧠✨
